Major works by Ravel and Kodály provided the frame for this fiercely focused recital from the violinist and cellist siblings.

When a violinist and a cellist want to play chamber music together, they generally seek out a pianist or more string players to create a trio or a quartet; the duo repertoire for their instruments is very small. But it does contain a couple of major works from the early 20th century by Ravel and Kodály, and it was those works that provided the frame for Christian and Tanja Tetzlaff’s recital.

Between the masterpieces, though, the siblings included one substantial recent contribution to the slender violin-and-cello literature. The two books of miniatures that make up Jörg Widmann’s 24 Duos date from 2008. None of them is very substantial – the shortest are just a few bars long – but like Kurtág’s cycles of tiny pieces they accumulate into something that seems more weighty. The writing for the two strings is wonderfully deft, and typically for Widmann it references a whole range of 20th-century composers, from Bartók to Lachenmann, though without ever finding a voice of its own. There’s always the feeling with Widmann that everything he writes is in inverted commas, as if he can only find a way through the tangle of styles available to composers today by looking back ironically at what has gone before.

The Tetzlaffs played the miniatures with the same compelling mix of supreme technical finesse and fiercely focused intensity they brought to both the Ravel and the Kodály. Christian seems the more expressively unbuttoned player of the two, attacking the more rebarbative passages in Ravel’s Sonata – its second-movement scherzo, often used as a textbook example of bitonality – with relish, and luxuriating in the rhapsodically nostalgic violin recitatives that introduce the finale of Kodály’s Duo. Tanja is the steadier, more measured player, though she did make the most of the grand melodic statements that Kodály regularly gives the cello too.
