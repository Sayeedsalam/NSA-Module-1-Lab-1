Last night, our readers had a thoroughly average time as they saw in the new year

Me, my husband Mother in law and Charlie Brooker on iplayer. Joy

All plans fell through. Luckily this six-pack and xbox can't bail on me. But if they had legs they might.

Toddlers floated past just a few seconds after this happy snap. I'd planned this evening meticulously and then the weather wished us both a very British New Year. Thank God I have a very patient partner and some Ethiopian food to rescue things later.

Need I say more than the title already does. The night was wild and long.

In pyjamas at 9.30 with the family - actually not disappointing but very much what I'd rather be doing on NYE, despite putting friends thinking I should be out on the town, finding a husband...

My sister brought numbered whistles to our family get together, along with a song sheet of numbers. Cue raspberries and squeaks to songs nobody recognised.

Stuck at the Fairbanks International Airport on New Year's Eve, supposed to be seeing Reel Big Fish tonight but the airplane is having mechanical issues :(

Frantically got up from the sofa and knocked squash on the floor. Highlight of the evening.

Fact: Jools Holland’s Hootenanny is actually filmed in a secret underground bunker in mid-February

We didn't quite get the decorating done in time to have a party

Meanwhile BBC1 had handed over responsibility for their New Year’s Eve entertainment to a Canadian from the 80s.

A New Year spent with a personal bowl of crisps watching Bryan Adams on the television. In my defence I am getting over a very nasty cold. Still managed to belt out 'Everything I do...' though. Winner.

My mum snapping the London fireworks on the tv with a disposable camera. Seeing the New Year in with a bang.

Perhaps rather embarrassingly for a 21 year old, I had not realised it was New Year's Eve and had not made any plans. I am happy to spend this evening with my family and thought I would share this photo of my grandma who poured our champagne down the sink!

With a bit of luck I'll have a house on the bus station by midnight.

Playing the "let's try and get the after eight off my forehead into my mouth" game. Exciting.

Went up to London from Bournemouth to see a uni friend, only no plans, so just riding the tubes

My son and his girlfriend. We've done Charades, played a card game, now what? Everyone has eaten too much and not drunk quite enough.
