Singer’s third album romped to almost 2.5m UK sales in only six weeks

It’s news that should come as no particular surprise, but has, none the less, been confirmed: Adele’s 25 is officially the UK’s “biggest” album of 2015. 

Following the news of Uptown Funk’s triumph in the combined singles charts, the newly unveiled list, based on Official Charts Company sales and audio streaming data, finds Adele’s third album at the very top of its end of year list. Her feat is made even more impressive considering the album is yet to be made available on streaming services, and the figure is therefore made up of purely digital and physical sales.At present, the album has sold 2.496m copies since it was released over six weeks ago in November. While her previous album 21 took 13 weeks to reach the same milestone, 25 crossed the 1m sales barrier in record time, in just 10 days.

Elsewhere in the top 10 is Ed Sheeran, who finished in second place with his second album X. It was released in June 2014 but renewed interest in the album surrounding his Wembley stadium shows last summer, by the end of the year, X finished on 971,000 combined sales for 2015 (making a total of 2.66m including 2014’s data). His debut, +, also features at No 38, four years after its release.

Aside from Adele and Sheeran, a host of British solo stars feature in the rest of the 2015 chart: No 3 is Sam Smith’s In The Lonely Hour, Jess Glynne’s I Cry When I Laugh arrives at No 7, James Bay’s Chaos and the Calm sits at No 8, and George Ezra caps off the top 10 with his debut, Wanted on Voyage.

At No 4 on the end of year chart is Elvis Presley’s If I Can Dream – orchestral reworkings of his biggest hits, while Justin Bieber’s fifth studio album Purpose, Taylor Swift and Coldplay round off the rest of the top slots.
