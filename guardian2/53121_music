Fans are invited to ‘toast’ the late Motörhead frontman as his ceremony is scheduled to be shown live online from Hollywood on Saturday night

Details of Ian “Lemmy” Kilmister’s funeral have been announced, and everyone is invited to watch it online. The legendary Motörhead frontman, who died on 28 December 2015, will have his funeral, in Hollywood, live streamed on YouTube on Saturday 9 January.

According to a Facebook statement from the band, friends and family are invited to attend a ceremony at Forest Lawn Memorial Cemetery in Hollywood, Los Angeles. But the band have asked fans to refrain from visiting – instead they have arranged for YouTube to show the ceremony via a live stream (which can be accessed here). The stream will run from 3pm PST to 4.30pm PST (11pm GMT to 12.30am GMT).

“We want you ALL to be a part of this memorial service,” wrote the band. “So wherever you are, PLEASE get together and watch with fellow Motörheadbangers and friends. GO to your favorite bar, or your favorite club, make sure they have access to an internet connection and toast along with us. Or simply invite your pals around and celebrate Lemm’s life at home.”They added: “Whatever your venue, and however you can, let’s be sure to gather globally on Saturday 9th and celebrate the life of our dear friend and irreplaceable icon.”

As well as the livestream, there will be a day-long celebration of Kilmister’s life at Rainbow Bar and Grill in Los Angeles. The rocker’s favourite bar had originally scheduled a 12-hour memorial service from 2pm PST, but demand was so high that this has now been extended down the Sunset Strip. The Roxy and the Whisky will now also be open to fans while the Rainbow hosts its own private service between 5pm and 9pm PST. 

Kilmister died from an aggressive form of cancer at the age of 70.
