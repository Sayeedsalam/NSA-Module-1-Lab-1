Trump denies sporty encounter with Jackson after actor claimed he’d been charged for membership of the politician’s golf club

Donald Trump has found himself yet another enemy in Hollywood. This time it’s Samuel L Jackson, as the two found themselves in a row over golf.

In a recent interview with Rhapsody magazine, the Oscar-nominated star claimed that the two had played golf together and also that Trump’s golf club charged him for membership, despite him not being a member. “Apparently he’d made me a member of one of his golf clubs, and I didn’t even know it!” Jackson said.

Trump then hit back on Twitter:

I don’t know @SamuelLJackson, to best of my knowledge haven't played golf w/him & think he does too many TV commercials—boring. Not a fan.

Despite being tagged in the tweet, Jackson remained unaware of its existence until he appeared on Late Night With Seth Meyers. “So, we’re having beef?” he asked. He then confirmed that the pair had definitely golfed together and this could be verified by Bill Clinton. 

Jackson then posted a receipt from Trump’s club on his Instagram account, “A bill from the guy that doesn’t know me & never golfed with me! I’m gonna Block his ass too!” he wrote. The post was later taken down. 

The star, currently appearing in Quentin Tarantino’s western The Hateful Eight, is the latest in a line of celebrities to land in a Twitter feud with the businessman turned politician. In the last few years, Trump has argued with Rosie O’Donnell, Russell Brand, Mac Miller and Cher.
