A smart New York comedy of sexual manners between ex-lovers.

Alison Brie deserves to sleep with whomever she wants, having spent seven seasons of Mad Men married to the lizard-like Pete Campbell. In this brisk New York comedy of sexual manners, Brie and Jason Sudeikis play Lainey and Jake, who slept together years ago but now enjoy a platonic if implicitly unchaste friendship; they’re sufficiently comfortable with each other to discuss a masturbation technique named the “Dirty DJ”.

Brie’s air of smart, startled prissiness nicely offsets the grit, while Sudeikis works those labrador jowls to amiable effect. Gags about Aaron Sorkin and Malcolm Gladwell make Leslye Headland’s script sometimes feel more like a 2015 zeitgeist-capsule than an organic piece of comedy, but the mix of sophistication and unabashed raunch has a definite light charm.
