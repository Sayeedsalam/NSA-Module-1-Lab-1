JJ Abrams’ space-saga movie has now outstripped previous record-holder Avatar in box-office takings, making over $700m in the US since its release

Star Wars: The Force Awakens has become the highest-grossing film in US box office history, without adjusting for inflation.

JJ Abrams’ space adventure, a continuation of the massively popular saga created by George Lucas, has topped the $760.5m (£520.36m) earned by James Cameron’s Avatar, which set the record in 2009. 

The Force Awakens, the seventh Star Wars movie, is only the second film to make more than $700m in the US. It also is on course to become the UK’s highest-grossing film, taking £94.7m in 17 days of release: a daily average of £5.7m. It’s currently sitting at number four on the all-time worldwide box-office chart, having taken $1.55bn (£1.06bn) to date. Avatar tops the chart with $2.79bn (£1.91bn). 

2015 was a record-breaking year at the US box office, with The Force Awakens, Jurassic World, Spectre and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 contributing to a $11bn haul (£7.52bn), beating the 2013 record by 2%. However, analysts have predicted that the total US box office will fall this year. 

Gone with the Wind still stands as the highest-grossing film of all time when inflation is taken into account. The takings from Victor Fleming’s epic romance, released in 1939, would add up to $3.44bn (£2.35bn) in today’s money, more than double The Force Awakens’s current global total.
