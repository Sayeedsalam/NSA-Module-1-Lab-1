The Prodigy frontman admits to attending a trail hunt in Essex, but says ‘no animals were hunted or killed, so my conscience is clear’

Keith Flint, frontman of electronic group the Prodigy, has started the new year defending reports that he was spotted on a fox hunt.

Flint has responded to reports that alleged he had invested in several hunting horses and that “his enthusiasm for the sport is the talk of Essex hunting circles”, clarifying that he has been on a trail hunt but did not kill any animals. 

In a Facebook post, he explains: 

In regards to a story going around about me right now - yes I live in Essex and have a couple of horses. I went riding with the local trail hunt, it was a ride out and NO ANIMALS WERE HUNTED OR KILLED, so my conscience is clear, it wasn’t my thing and I won’t be going again.

Flint has been criticised on social media for joining a hunt, and the Essex musician has also been targeted by a group purporting to be part of the hacking group Anonymous. In a video, posted by a user named AnonIntelGroup, Flint is lambasted for his allegiance with “Tory criminals”.

“We once had a great deal of respect for you - we admired your art, your rage, your vision and your haircut,” the masked figure says. “But now Anonymous have targeted you with the message, because you disgrace what we stand for.”

In January 2015, the Prodigy released a comeback single, Nasty, which included a video depicting a cartoon fox being chased through the grimy streets of a sinister city.
