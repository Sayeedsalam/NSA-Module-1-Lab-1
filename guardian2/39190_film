JJ Abrams’ sequel is set to challenge Avatar as the highest-grossing film in North America, while Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight climbs to No 3 at the weekend with $16.2m bounty

Star Wars: The Force Awakens hit the $1.5bn (£1.01bn) mark at the global box office this weekend after earning $88.3m in North America during its third week of release.

JJ Abrams’ sequel has now made $740.3m at the US and Canadian box office, putting it in second place on the chart of highest-grossing films in North America, behind Avatar’s $760.8m from 2009/2010. Disney’s film is expected to take the No 1 spot by midweek.

The third-highest weekend haul ever in the US means that The Force Awakens could challenge Avatar’s $2.78bn all-time global box office record. The latest instalment of Star Wars opens in China, the world’s second-largest box office, on 9 January amid huge expectations.

Elsewhere at the US box office, it was a good weekend for Oscar contenders. Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight climbed to No 3 after a successful limited release on Christmas Day in the 70mm screening format. The blood-spattered western took $16.2m on its wide-release debut. It is considerably less than the opening weekend results of Tarantino’s two most recent films, Inglourious Basterds ($38m) and Django Unchained ($30.1m). Expectations for The Hateful Eight, however, have been dampened by the ongoing success of The Force Awakens. Tarantino’s new movie has made $29.6m so far.

David O Russell’s Joy dropped three places to sixth with $10.4m, for a two-week total of $38.7m, while the financial crisis-themed comedy drama The Big Short held seventh place with $9m in its fourth week ($33m total). The Will Smith-led sports drama Concussion dipped to eighth spot with $8m, for a two-week total of $25.4m.
