Rising indie stars and BBC Sound of 2016 hot picks unveil the title track of their new EP

As results of the BBC Sound of 2016 poll arrived back in November, one act stood out among the list of mostly solo artists and producers creating future R&B, pop and grime. Blossoms, a Stockport five-piece with long hair, leather jackets and guitars, are an indie band, the kind who look, sound and swagger as if emerging bleary-eyed from Kokoâ€™s Club NME in 2005.

There is, the band have said, more to their sound than straight up guitar rock. As previously mentioned in our New Band of the Week series, Blossoms admire the music of the Arctic Monkeys and Abba in equal measure, and their new single, At Most A Kiss, is certainly indicative of their love of both buoyant synth melodies, unvarnished glam rock and epic 00s indie pop. 

Taken from their new EP entitled At Most A Kiss on 19 February, their moody monochrome video for the title track is premiered below. Let us know what you think!
