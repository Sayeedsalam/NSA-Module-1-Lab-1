Ronson’s song held off competition from OMI’s Cheerleader to rack up a sales and streaming total of 1.76m over the last 12 months

It’s official: Mark Ronson’s Uptown Funk was the biggest song of 2015. Despite being released in November 2014, the song racked up a combined sales and streaming total of 1.76m over the last 12 months, more than any other track. 

According to Official Charts Company data, Ronson’s track held off competition from OMI’s Cheerleader (Felix Jaehn Remix), which finished in second place with a combined sales total of 1.52m. In third place was Hozier’s Take Me to Church which racked up 1.25m combined sales, despite never hitting the No 1 spot. Making up the top five were Ellie Goulding’s 50 Shades of Grey song Love Me Like You Do (1.19m) and Wiz Khalifa’s See You Again (1.17m). 

Despite not being released until November, Adele’s Hello entered at number six. The rest of the top 10 was comprised of Major Lazer featuring Mo and DJ Snake’s Lean On, James Bay’s Hold Back the River and Justin Bieber’s two hits What Do You Mean? and Sorry. 

It’s testament to Uptown Funk’s staying power that nothing released this year could outsell it. The track spent a total of seven weeks at No 1 in the UK, with 39 in the top 40. The song’s total combined sales since its release in November 2014 stand at 2.25m.
