Travel group also helped by news of possible offer for rival Kuoni

With leading shares drifting lower after a failed attempt to recover from Monday’s rout, there are a few notable gainers.

Apart from Royal Mail and Tesco, travel group Tui is also heading higher, up 29p to £12.36. It is currently the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 following a buy note from Deutsche Bank, even though the bank’s analysts have cut their target price form £13.85 to £13.45.

The company is also benefitting from news that Swiss rival Kuoni said it had received tentative offers to buy the business. Earlier Bloomberg had reported that Swedish buyout business EQT was interested in Kuoni.

Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is currently down 5.29 points at 6088.14.
