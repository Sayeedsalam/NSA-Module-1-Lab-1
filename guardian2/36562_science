Nasa will begin work on converting an old spy satellite for astronomical use earlier than anticipated thanks to an unexpected influx of funding.

US Congress has granted $90m for the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFirst) mission this year, well in excess of the $16m Nasa had expected.

The US space agency had assumed spending on WFirst would only increase after they completed the wildly over-budget James Webb Space Telescope, set for launch in 2018. Congress had other ideas, and not for the first time.

Last year, Nasa asked for $14m but received $50m for WFirst. This allowed the telescope to pass a critical concept review in December. The new money allows the project to begin in earnest.

The National Reconnaissance Office offered Nasa the unwanted spy satellite telescope in January 2011. With a mirror 2.4 metres in diameter, it is the same size as the Hubble Space Telescope, but was clearly designed to look down at Earth rather than out into space because it has a much wider field of view.

Astronomers realised it was exactly what they wanted to perform a survey of galaxies, but WFirst has competition. The European Space Agency is already building the Euclid mission to do exactly this. It will launch in 2020, about five years earlier than its Nasa rival.

To extend WFirstâ€™s mission objectives beyond the survey, the Nasa telescope is being fitted with equipment to take pictures of nearby planets around other stars. It will also monitor distant stars to discover more of these so-called exoplanets.
