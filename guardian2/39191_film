Latest instalment in the long-running space saga takes second place in all-time list of biggest films at the UK and Ireland box office

Star Wars: The Force Awakens has overtaken James Bond movie Spectre to become the biggest film of 2015 at the UK box office. JJ Abrams’ space opera sequel has taken £97.6m in Britain and Ireland, moving it ahead of Spectre’s £93.5m as of last weekend.

Disney’s debut entry in the long-running Star Wars saga also rose to second place on the all-time UK and Ireland box-office chart, ahead of Avatar’s £94m. It is poised to become the highest-grossing film of all time in the UK and Ireland this weekend, ahead of Skyfall’s record £103m haul from 2012.

The Force Awakens has been boosted by hugely positive reviews in the UK, including five-star verdicts from the Guardian, Telegraph and Times, and because the movie maintains a strong British identity. Abrams’ film was shot on location at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire and Puzzlewood in the Forest of Dean, as well as on the tiny island of Skellig Michael in Ireland and in Abu Dhabi. Lead cast members Daisy Ridley, who plays scavenger Rey, and John Boyega, as rogue stormtrooper Finn, are British.

The Force Awakens attracted controversy last month when it emerged that chancellor George Osborne’s name appears on the credits, courtesy of the movie being counted as a “British” film for tax purposes.
