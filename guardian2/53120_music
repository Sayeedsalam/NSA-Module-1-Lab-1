We’re premiering a new krautrock-inspired track from the band’s debut album – have a listen and let us know your thoughts

By the sound of things, Berlin’s electronic music dominance never ended for Cavern of Anti-Matter. The krautrock-inspired band, featuring ex-Stereolab members Tim Gane and Joe Dilworth as well as delightfully named synth player Holger Zapf, first channelled the German capital’s humming energy and musical legacy into a smattering of limited-edition vinyl releases in 2013. 

Their knack for weaving motorik rhythms under warm guitars continued in 2015. In November, fans got their first taste of new music from forthcoming debut album Void Beats/Invocation Trex with the release of Melody in High Feedback Tones. Now we’re sharing album opener Tardis Cymbals, a propulsive 12-minute instrumental track, and the second song to be shared before Void Beats’s release in February.

“Cavern of Anti-Matter are spectrum addicts, setting up tiny rhythmic cells and expanding on them in certain ways, splitting the melody and stretching out,” Gane said of the band’s sweeping and experimental sound. Elsewhere on the album, listeners can expect to hear guests Bradford Cox (Deerhunter) and Sonic Boom AKA Peter Kember, formerly of Spacemen 3, while German electronic musician Jan St Werner, of Mouse on Mars, is said to be responsible for “sound processing” on one of the album tracks.
