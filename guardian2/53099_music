The countertenor, with his astonishingly beautiful voice and exemplary breath control, made a strong case for the neglected 18th-century composer Johann Adolph Hasse.

For his Wigmore Hall recital with Armonia Atenea and its artistic director George Petrou, the cult Croatian countertenor Max Emanuel Cencic offered a programme of arias by Johann Adolph Hasse, of whose work he has long been a champion. A younger contemporary of Handel and Vivaldi, Hasse was immensely popular on the European mainland in the 18th century. His music fell out of fashion after his death in 1783, however. Cencic, whose musicological intelligence matches his glamour as a performer, has become something of a pioneer in its revival.

He proved himself a most persuasive advocate on this occasion, revealing Hasse to be an affecting melodist, though lacking Handel’s immediacy and Vivaldi’s innate sensuality. Cencic’s voice is, of course, astonishingly beautiful, dark and handsome in tone, with no sense of strain at the top or of baritonal forcing in his lower registers. His exemplary breath control allowed him to unfold the long, sinewy lines of arias such as Se Volete, Eterni Dei from Arminio with exquisite poise. His coloratura dazzles, but is never self-consciously showy, and the big showstoppers such as Solca il Mar e nel Periglio from Tigrane were quite remarkable in their intensity.

Petrou, a stylish conductor of great charm, has been a regular collaborator with Cencic in his reappraisal of Hasse. Armonia Atenea, however, took a while to settle on this occasion – there were a couple of moments of suspect intonation near the start – but came into their own in the instrumental works that punctuated the recital when Cencic was taking a breather. Theodoros Kitsos was the super-elegant soloist in Hasse’s beguiling Mandolin Concerto in G. And the complex variations of Vivaldi’s D Minor Trio Sonata, Op 1 No 12 “La Follia” were at once beautifully controlled and buzzing with excitement.
