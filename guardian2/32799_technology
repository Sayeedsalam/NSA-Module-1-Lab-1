Social media site deletes post about Armstrong Renata by internet group Anonymous Australia after changing its mind about breach of standards

Facebook has removed a post by the internet group Anonymous Australia that the Queensland law society warned could jeopardise the prosecution of accused killer of Brisbane teenager Cole Miller.

The social media site deleted the post, which sought to disparage the character of Armstrong Renata, after reversing its original position on whether it breached its “community standards”.

Renata and Daniel Maxwell, both 21, were charged with unlawful striking causing death when Miller succumbed to head injuries after an alleged one-punch attack in Brisbane’s Chinatown mall early Sunday morning.

The Queensland Law Society president, Bill Potts, had warned that online material “electronic lynch mobs [that] were appealing to prejudice” about Renata’s character could lead to a mistrial because it had the potential to influence jurors.

Guardian Australia understands Facebook initially told a complainant about the Anonymous post that it did not violate its standards, later saying it had removed a photo of Renata from the post because it did.

The comments thread accompanying the post, which had been shared almost 40,000 times by Wednesday, no longer appears on Anonymous’s Facebook site.

The group posted on Thursday: “We’ve had our recent post taken down, and we’ve been given yet another formal warning from the high ups of Facebook.

“Though we haven’t broken any laws, we’ve apparently offended too many people which is an apparent breach of their guidelines.”

Anonymous defended its role in public outcry over Miller’s death, saying it had “worked together to find a witness who the family had sought out, we have passed around a few fundraisers that have been made, we stood our ground on coward punches and we took a stand for what we believed in”.
