The star of new Bollywood film Dilwale has spoken out against piracy after a man watched an illegal version of the film on his iPhone, while sitting next to her on a plane.

Kriti Sanon was travelling to Delhi with her mother when she noticed that the passenger next to her was watching the pirated copy. Sanon reported that she asked the man to stop viewing the film, but he refused.
