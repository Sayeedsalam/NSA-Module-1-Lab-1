A classic snowball with a British twist

Swap advocaat for custard, among other things, and you end up with a very British take on the classic snowball. Per serving:

40ml citron vodka20ml lemon juice15ml sugar syrup60ml pre-made custardLemonade, to topGlâcé cherry, to garnish

Pour everything but the lemonade into a cocktail shaker, shake, then strain into a highball glass. Top with lemonade – go slow, as it will bubble up – garnish and serve.
