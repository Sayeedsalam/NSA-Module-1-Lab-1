Star rapper auditions for J-Lo, Keith Urban and Harry Connick Jr to promote new series of talent show … and gets their thumbs-up

If recent televised history is anything to go by, there is nothing more exposing and degrading than a talent show audition. Vocals are stripped bare of instrumentation, every move is under the scrutiny of millions of viewers, and, in the case of American Idol, the watchful eye of Jennifer Lopez. 

So, can Kanye West survive the scrupulous process? In the run-up to the final series of the US talent show, American Idol have released footage of West performing in front of judges, and unfortunately for some, the mogul opts for a mildly ambitious and moderately pleasing self-parody rather than going all-out, avant-garde Robert Unwin-styled a cappella. 

Whether or not he will take part in the next stage of the show is yet to be seen, but one thing is for sure: Kanye West will literally do anything to avoid recording Swish.
