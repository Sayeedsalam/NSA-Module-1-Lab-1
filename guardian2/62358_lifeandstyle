What are your running resolutions and how did you see in the new year? As always, share your weekend woes and plans for the future below the line

Happy new year, runners. How did you see it in? Last year I spent New Year’s Day staggering up quite a few metres of ascent on Box Hill, for the Knacker Cracker race. This year I managed over 1,000 foot of ascent - ouch. I was on holiday in lovely Valloire, near the Col du Galibier, which frequently appears on the route of the Tour de France. The only way I could get up to the top there on a bike would be one with a motor, but I did run a few miles up it, before the road got too icy for my road shoes and I came back down again (ouch again, poor quads). 

Now that it’s 2016 it’s time to start taking marathon training for London a bit more seriously. So my new year’s resolutions are just to try and hit as many of those target paces and distances as possible. One of the hardest types of run that David, my coach (and astas!) has me doing is the long run with blocks at marathon pace. I just about managed one of those yesterday, though today’s recovery run is going to be a slow stagger forward. 

So what are your running resolutions, if you’ve made any? Looking back over last year I discovered, via the joys of stats on Garmin Connect, that I ran over 3,000 miles last year. According to Googles, Boston is 3280 miles from London, so this year maybe I should just aim to run there and tick off another marathon major ...
