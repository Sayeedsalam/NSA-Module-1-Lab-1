The lunch box: Sometimes just a single ingredient can change an otherwise pedestrian sandwich or snack into something altogether more luxurious

A sandwich is a lunch for all seasons. But the ideal winter sandwich has a little more heft and perhaps a more luxurious combination of ingredients – or just something extra (think of the much-anticipated Pret Christmas sandwich: it’s the crispy onions that really make it). Here are ideas for bread or cracker-based things to look forward to and get you through these dark January days.

• Chop half a small pumpkin – keep the skin on – into slim (15mm-ish) wedges. Put on a foil-covered baking tray, season with salt, pepper, dried chilli flakes and a drizzle of oil, toss together and roast in an oven preheated to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 for 25 minutes, or until tender. Crush half a small garlic clove and add to 2.5 tbsp yoghurt with a pinch of salt and a tiny squeeze of lemon. If you are lucky enough to live near a Turkish supermarket, then this sandwich is brilliant made with freshly made flatbread; if not, toasted pitta is also great. Pack up your filling ingredients ready to assemble at work: flatbread or pitta, garlic yoghurt, roast pumpkin, a good handful of washed watercress and some pumpkin seeds. Assemble in that order. Chilli sauce is a good spicy addition.

• A sausage sandwich isn’t just for Sunday mornings. Cut 2 cooked sausages in half lengthways and two slices of sourdough, or whatever bread you have. Spread one slice with dijon mustard, then add the sausages, cut-side down. Put on the top half of bread and wrap firmly. Very thinly slice or mandoline half a small fennel bulb. Add to a tupperware with ¼ tin of cannellini beans, a good squeeze of lemon juice and a grating of zest, a drizzle of olive oil, and some salt and pepper. Mix to combine, squishing down the beans a bit. At lunchtime, add the marinated fennel to the sausages, re-sandwich together and enjoy. A few shavings of parmesan would be an enjoyably extravagant extra.

• Lord it up with a smoked salmon and speed-pickled cucumber sandwich or bagel (throw in some dill and sliced cooked beetroot too if you really want to push the boat out). In advance, thinly slice a cucumber and sprinkle over plenty of salt. Leave for 10 minutes, then rinse, dry, and cover with a mix of sugar, vinegar and a few mustard seeds. Wait for 5 minutes, then add to your smoked salmon sandwich, the bread spread with a base layer of cream cheese or butter.

• Try a simple homemade winter kale pesto with roasted tomatoes on Ryvita or similar: a great desk assembly number. To make the pesto: Strip kale leaves from the stalks and blitz with lemon juice, a little water, olive oil, parmesan, garlic, and pine nuts. Quickly roast some halved cherry tomatoes sprinkled with olive oil and salt. Come lunchtime spread the bottom layer with the kale pesto and top with the cherry tomatoes.
