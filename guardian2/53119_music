Hunting enthusiast responds to the US President’s plans to tighten gun control, with social media rant

Barack Obama may have cried during his speech on gun control but it seems at least one rocker wasn’t moved. Ted Nugent took to Facebook following the president’s words and labelled him a “psychopathic, America-hating liar”. 

“I will write a comprehensive piece on the Chicago scam artist in chief on his latest lies about tyranical [sic] trampling of the 2nd Amendment,” wrote Nugent, “but know it ye all goodmen everywhere that his ongoing criminal oath violating INFRINGEMENTS would NOT have stopped nor will ever stop ANY mass shootings or crime that anyone is aware of. He is a psychopathic America hating liar.”

Nugent went on to suggest his fans should buy memberships to the NRA for everyone they know. In a response to one Facebook user, he turned his nose up at the idea of visiting the UK, where he equated the lower availability of guns with “no freedom”. 

Nugent is not normally a supporter of Obama, and has ties with the Republican party. He has previously expressed views advocating hunting, with his Facebook page displaying photos of him holding the corpses of lions and deer he presumably shot. 

Obama’s new gun control law aims to expand background checks for buyers. In an emotional speech, the president referred to massacres such as the Sandy Hook shooting that killed 20 children and six adults in 2012. “Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad,” he said.
