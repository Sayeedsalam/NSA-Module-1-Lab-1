The grime evangelist and BBC Radio 1Xtra DJ empties the contents of his psychic record bag

I have a dubplate special of this which I love to open my sets with; it lets people know what they are in for!

I’ve never really had to rescue a dancefloor. As a grime specialist, if the dancefloor isn’t reacting well to what I am playing then it would be a pretty dire situation for me! But this record always does the trick.

This record I played out before anyone had heard it; that’s actually included in the viral video for the song. And it got a reaction immediately. That’s powerful in this age when people only really respond to records they already know or recognise.

I’ve been playing this out and it’s had a really good response. The beat and bars are both sick!

When I was young, I used to watch MTV2 for the eclectic mix of amazing videos. This one always stuck in my mind. A mix between apocalyptic drum’n’bass sounds and Saul Williams’s incredible manic spoken word.

Tried and tested at some of the biggest festivals in the UK this summer. Big Narstie is a legend.

Rocks is a very talented guy. He is part of a long line of grime MCs that produce their own beats, too.

I don’t prescribe to this whole watching the sun set at Café Mambo life. I’m a grime DJ, everyone get up and get lively!

This should have charted HIGH! It was the biggest track of the summer. A massive movement for the whole scene.

I’m happy with my loved ones picking whatever track made them feel the best.
