Are You Now Or Have You Ever Been… ? | Jean-Luc Godard

The closing half of that title is “… a member of the Communist party?”, a question that could have presaged the end of your career and possibly your liberty in 1950s Hollywood. Now we can eat brunch over it, safe in the knowledge that a McCarthy-style witch hunt could never happen again – could it? In advance of Trumbo, a Bryan Cranston-led biopic on the Hollywood Ten writer (out 5 Feb), this season revisits those bad old days each Sunday this month. Proceedings begin tomorrow with sci-fi allegory Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, and continues with Clifford Odets’s lid-lifting Hollywood drama The Big Knife (Odets was one of those who cooperated with the committee) and Woody Allen-starring satire The Front (featuring cast and crew who actually were blacklisted), culminating in Spartacus, the film that literally restored Dalton Trumbo’s name.

It seems incredible that Godard still walks, and makes films, among us. He’s one of the few survivors from that bygone era when films really mattered, and few films have mattered more than his. Godard changed, challenged and expanded cinema in so many ways, it’s difficult to know where to start. In fact, it’s going to take three months for BFI to do his six-decade career justice, from game-changing debut feature A Bout De Souffle right up to 2014’s Goodbye To Language. And if the auteur himself won’t literally walk among us, some key collaborators and commentators will at least, including his ex-wife and regular player Anna Karina, who accompanies screenings of Vivre Sa Vie, Bande À Part and Le Mépris on 16 January – the latter of which (as good a place as any to start with Godard) gets an extended release this month.
