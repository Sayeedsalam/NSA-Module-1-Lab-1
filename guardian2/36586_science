I’ve been looking out for an example of when the indefinite article, “a”, can legitimately be pronounced “ay”, ie when it’s to be stressed. I found one in your article on the TV series Girls (8 January): “I may be the voice of my generation – or at least the voice of a generation.” What is driving me crazy is that nowadays everybody, including professionals all over the BBC and other channels, says “ay” all the time, instead of the correct short “a”. What is going on here? The other night I even heard somebody stress “an” when there was no earthly need to. Has anybody else noticed this? Kids are beginning to do it too. It sounds awful!Lynne Reid BanksShepperton, Surrey

• Roger Fisken (Letters, 12 January) hits the nail on the head when he points out that the fire service only deals with emergencies. They put out the fire and then the private insurance and building industries take over. The government’s agenda for the hospital services suddenly becomes blindingly obvious.David AbbeyEgham, Surrey

• So, older people have problems “decoding” sarcasm, according to researchers (Shortcuts, G2, 13 January)? I have to warn them, if they included my former English teacher Geoff Weekes (turning 90 next week) in their study, he was definitely taking the piss.Judith MackinlayManchester
